# Parking Car Detector
Part of Cyber Parking App for monitoring car parking from a bird's eye view. <br>
It allows to show licence plates of all cars in the parking from the top view and track their current position while moving. <br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

# Key Features:
  * Distinguishing cars from other objects
  * Monitoring the current positions of cars in the parking lot using the main camera
  * Adding and removing vehicles currently in the parking lot to/from the database
  * Storing the current positions of cars in the parking lot until they leave
  * Highlighting car positions with a blue bounding box
  * Assigning a license plate number to each detected vehicle
  * Displaying all detected cars along with their license plates and bounding boxes in the application window

## Badly detected cars:
Sometimes app doesn't detect everything as it should, the parking lot should well illuminated to detect cars perfectly.

# Whole Cyber Parking App Demo:
Part of app that is presented in this repository was used in bigger project as a top-view camera of the parking lot.<br>
Here will be some short videos (as gifs) showcasing most key features of this app.<br>
All videos will have: <br> 
* Database window on the right
* Main camera window in the top left corner
* Entry camera window with the text that it is seeing next to it, in the down left corner
* Exit camera window with the text that it is seeing next to it, in the down left corner below entry camera window

## Detecting licence plates of cars:
The entry camera detects numbers and letters from the licence plate and show them. <br>
If the licence plate matches the allowed licence plate from the database, it is added to the table with current cars on the parking lot, and the entry gate opens. <br><br>

## Car entering parking lot:
After car enters the parking lot, it is immediately detected by the top-down camera. <br>
From now on it will have blue bounding box around it and its licence plate number. <br>
Its current position while moving will be tracked by the camera. <br> <br>

## More cars entering parking lot:
As more cars enter the parking lot, we can see that the camera still correctly tracks position of each induvidual car.<br><br>

## Car leaving parking lot:
As the car leaves the parking lot, the top-down camera removes it from cars that its tracking. <br>
The exit camera detects the licence plate and removes the car from the database. <br><br>

## Cars entering and leaving parking lot at the same time:
The cars can simultaneously enter and leave the parking lot at the same time. <br><br>
